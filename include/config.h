// reset the algorithm if time overflows
// preferably, time should be in ms, if not, use timeScalingFactor in the preprocessing stage to adjust it to ms
// example: a year worth of ms needs 35 bits, 32 bits allows you to store about 50 days of ms
// as time doesn't go back, using unsigned integers makes sense

// this should be 1 bit bigger than accel_t
// example: if the accelerometer works at 12 bits, magnitude should be 13 bits, therefore choosing int16_t for both will do

// example: accelerometer works at 12 bits, the filter has 8 taps -> accumulator should be at least 12 + 3 bits -> using int16_t will do

// steps count type
